Project overview
This project runs a server that connections a runnable class. 
It can display a folder with files.
it is meant to have download capabilites.
it parses a xml document using dom
it has a simple menu intereface
it is meant to work with command line but mine only runs in the eclispe compiler
it can quit out of the function when needed.
it should have a blocking que
and file servering
included in the project is a java doc and a jar file

How to Run
to Run this you open the java project in Eclipse
you run the runner.java file first and this displays the UI menu
then you select your option
you press one to connect to the server which runs the connection class
your press two to display the files in the file folder via the file finder class
you press three to download files but I have not got this step working so it throws up a error message so I have basic error handling for it
you press 4 it quits the runner and stops the function in the eclispe console.

my comments
there are a few steps I did not get working in this project such as download and file servering along with the blocking que
I do have xml parsing and server connections
I do not have it working with the cmd console
ive reference w3schools as I used it as a aid
doing this project I learned things in java I had not before and If I was to do this again I would start earlier and look up more tutorials.
Along with better timing and coding practice.
I would also figure solutions to the problems I occured and have more functionality working as this submission is lacking some.
This was one of the tougher projects I have done but I enjoy the challenge and I hope this will submission will sufice.
